# 0x19 C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers concepts of Stacks, Queues, LIFO, FIFO implementation.
This was a duo project with the awesome partner github.com/Kelvzzy

At the end of this project, We were able to solve these questions:
  
* What do LIFO and FIFO mean
* What is a stack, and when to use it
* What is a queue, and when to use it
* What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
* What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
* What is the proper way to use global variables
